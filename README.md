# Jingle-Bells-Chorus.
This project is a Python script that plays the melody of "Jingle Bells" using the pygame library to generate sound. The tune is created programmatically with specified notes and durations.

# Features

Plays the "Jingle Bells" melody.

Supports the addition of custom notes to extend or modify the tune.

Uses pygame for sound generation.

Generates sine wave tones for each musical note.

# Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Python 3.x

pygame library

numpy library

You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install pygame numpy

# How to Use

Clone this repository or download the script file.

Run the script:

python jingle_bells.py

Ensure your speakers or headphones are connected to hear the output.

# File Structure

jingle_bells.py: The main script containing the code to play the melody.

# How It Works

Note Definition: The notes of the melody are defined as a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the frequency (in Hz) and the duration (in seconds) of the note.

Sound Generation: A sine wave is generated for each note using numpy to simulate the corresponding pitch.

Playback: The generated waveforms are converted to audio signals using pygame.sndarray and played sequentially.


# Example Output

When you run the script, it plays the melody for "Jingle Bells" with the following sequence of notes:

E E E | E E E | E G C D E

Repeats and includes additional verses like "Oh what fun it is to ride" and "Dashing through the snow."

Troubleshooting

No sound? Check your speakers or headphones.

Errors about missing libraries? Ensure pygame and numpy are installed properly.

pip install pygame numpy
